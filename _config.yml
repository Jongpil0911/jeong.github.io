          Currently, I research about the deblurring algorithm, low-light enhancement, algorithm optimization, and digital holographic microscopy(DHM).
          At the 3D Optical Imaging Systems Lab, I have a lot of oppertunities to handle the many kinds of image processing methods.
          My noticeable paper is "Scattering Medium Removal Using Adaptive Masks for Scatter in Spatial Frequency Domain", which is published at IEEE Access.
          Based on this method, we apply for a patent at Japanese Patent Office.
          Moreovr, I have a lot of interest about the biomedical imaging systems, such as digital holographic microscopy, and published the confereces.

          Currently, I am researching deblurring algorithms, low-light enhancement, algorithm optimization, and digital holographic microscopy (DHM). 
          At the [3D Optical Imaging Systems Lab](https://leelab.csn.kyutech.ac.jp/index.php/en/home-en/), I have had numerous opportunities to work with various image processing methods under the guidance of my advisor, [Prof. Min-Chul Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9sv1-5QAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 
          My notable paper, “Scattering Medium Removal Using Adaptive Masks for Scatter in Spatial Frequency Domain,” was published in IEEE Access. 
          Based on this method, we have applied for a patent at the Japanese Patent Office. 
          Furthermore, I am highly interested in biomedical imaging systems, such as digital holographic microscopy, and I have published several conference papers in this area.

          I have a strong interest in image and signal processing. 
          Consequently, I participated as a research student at [SoC Design Lab](https://soc.donga.ac.kr/soc/Main.do).
          At the lab, I received training in fundamental image processing methods and various programming languages, including MATLAB, C/C++, Python, and Verilog. 
          My advisor, Prof. Bongsoon Kang, provided significant inspiration regarding research and future plans. 
          Through this experience, I gained a broader perspective of the world and the opportunity to pursue a master's course in Japan.
